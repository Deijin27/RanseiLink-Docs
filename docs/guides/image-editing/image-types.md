# Image Types

## Pokemon Battle Sprites

![Eevee sprite sheet](../../assets/image-types/pokemon-battle-sprites.png)

The animated sprites displayed in-battle for pokemon. They justify their own dedicated page to explain how to create and import them:

[Pokemon Battle Sprite Guide](./pokemon-battle-sprite-guide.md)

## Warrior Battle Speak

![Oichi sprite with green outline](../../assets/image-types/warrior-battle-speak.png)

These are what shows during battle when the warrior orders the pokemon to use an attack. The green border is replaced with flashing color. You should surround your image with this green border.

## Warrior/Pokemon Battle Intro

![Battle intro screen with male player at the top and eevee at the bottom. Text reads "I'll show you what I'm made of!"](../../assets/image-types/battle-intro.png){ width="300" }

These are the leader of the army image which slides in from the side of the screen during the intro of the battle along with the pokemon image ([the position that it stops at can be adjusted in ranseilink on the pokemon page](../../research/game-data/pokemon-battle-intro-sprite-offset.md)).

## Game Intro Player

![Female player sprite](../../assets/image-types/game-intro-player.png)

This is shown on the player gender select screen

## Warrior XLarge

![Female shopkeeper sprite](../../assets/image-types/warrior-xl.png)

A lot of these are empty placeholders, but if you scroll down you will see the sprites used for things like shopkeepers

## Warrior Medium

![Hideyoshi's face on a paint stroke background](../../assets/image-types/warrior-m.png)

These are shown on the top screen during a battle

## Warrior Small / Kingdom Castle Icon / Pokemon Small

![Small cropped sprite of motochika face](../../assets/image-types/warrior-s.png)
![Small cropped icon of aurora kingdom with the text "Aurora"](../../assets/image-types/kingdom-s.png)
![Small cropped leafeon sprite facing left](../../assets/image-types/pokemon-sl.png)
![Small cropped leafeon sprite facing right](../../assets/image-types/pokemon-sr.png)

These little square icons are used in various places to give a compact representation of a warrior/kingdom/pokemon. e.g. The screen where you choose what warriors to bring to a battle, the gallery list etc. There is one pokemon for left and right, because some are asymmetrical.

## Warrior Large

![Male warrior sprite, looking very excited about something, probably overwhelming victory and plunder](../../assets/image-types/warrior-l.png)

These are large images of warriors used during dialog, and in some other places. Each warrior has multiple sprites for each emotion. The emotion used is specified alongside the message in the Text editor in RanseiLink.

## Battle Terrain Icon

![Small square border containing an image of a slice of ground where the surface is red, this is the sprite for the "Magma" terrain](../../assets/image-types/battle-terrain.png)

This is shown on the top screen as you move the cursor around in battle, and indicates the terrain-type of that cell. You can modify the terrain in the map editor. It has interesting not-obvious functions, for example grass type pokemon controlled by the AI will prefer to move to grass terrain.

## Event Image

![Picture of some warriors, along with a chimeco, zebstrika, and sealeo watching some fireworks at night](../../assets/image-types/event-img.png)

Just some nicely-drawn images that show up while on-screen text is describing some events.

## Event Background

![Background image used for events in aurora, depicting the front gate of the aurora castle](../../assets/image-types/event-bg.png)

Fullscreen images that show up in various places, one of which is the background while conversations go on in the foreground.

## Pokemon Medium

![Small sprite of leafeon facing left](../../assets/image-types/pokemon-ml.png)
![Small sprite of leafeon facing right](../../assets/image-types/pokemon-mr.png)

There is left and right because some pokemon are asymmetrical. They're called unknown just because I wasn't sure where in particular they were from in the game, and I just never updated the name. They appear in various places.

## Pokemon Large

![Sprite of glaceon with one of its front paws raised and the dangly things on its head curved as if in motion](../../assets/image-types/pokemon-l.png)

These are large drawings of pokemon in dynamic poses, used when a pokemon is evolving, and many other places. There is one for each pokemon.

## Pokemon XLarge

![Sprite of eevee in the fetal position looking scared with its eyes closed and mouth open, some splashes of water come off its head](../../assets/image-types/pokemon-xl.png)

These may pop up alongside the warrior if they have this pokemon in their party. We haven't figured out what maps pokemon-id to sprite-id yet.

## Staff Roll

![A page of the credits on a black background. The text reads "Sound Editing: Ayako Toyoda, Takashi Yoshida. Tools Programmer: Yuki Okamoto"](../../assets/image-types/staffroll.png)

The game credits. Yuki Okamoto is the Tools Programmer; I'd love to see the tools they used to develop this game!

## Gimmick Objects

![Square sprite with a scarecrow wearing a straw hat](../../assets/image-types/gimmick-obj.png)

These are shown on the top screen in battle when you hover over a gimmick object. What could this scarecrow have been planned for?

## Title

![Title screen of pokemon conquest, showing zekrom in the foreground with glowing red eyes, and nobunaga in the background, clounds swooping in the foreground, very menacing](../../assets/image-types/title.png)

A collection of images, mainly for the title screen of the game, so you can customise this to match your rom hack.
