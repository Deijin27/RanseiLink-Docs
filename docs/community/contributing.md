## Reporting Bugs

We can't fix bugs if we don't know about them, so please report any you find. Provide as much info as you can, the more details the easier it is to reproduce and ultimately fix the problem. Don't worry about if it's a duplicate, we don't get many reports at the moment so keeping on top of things is easy.

You can find a bug report button on the home page of RanseiLink to make reporting more convenient, automatically including relevant information such as the version of RanseiLink that you're on. Github does require you to make an account but other than that it's a smooth experience. In the case of crashes, RanseiLink will give you a dialog box with the option to report too, attaching the full crash log to the issue automatically.

## Research

All new features of RanseiLink are driven by diligent research and amazing discoveries by the community.

Examples:

- [Bagon Discovered](https://github.com/Deijin27/RanseiLink/discussions/57) how to control the order of pokemon move animations.
- [Geodude Discovered](https://github.com/Deijin27/RanseiLink/discussions/56) that Catch Rate affects the facility level that a pokemon appears in.
