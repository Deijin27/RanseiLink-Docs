## Discuss

For discussions and ideas you have you can use the [discussions page](https://github.com/Deijin27/RanseiLink/discussions) on github.

RanseiLink doesn't have an official discord, but I would strongly recommend the [Ransei Region Discord Server](https://discord.gg/NSCJ4yuRfa) to connect with other pokemon conquest fans.
