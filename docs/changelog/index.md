# Changelog

## 6.1 <small>- Dec 13, 2024</small> { id="6.1" }

**Features**

- Map Editor Improvements
    - Support drag when editing so you can paint multiple cells in one mouse press and drag
    - New map view modes for Bounds and Orientation. Note, it's currently unknown what the difference is between the orientation stored in cells, and the orientation stored in gimmick and pokemon entries.
    - Reworked painting functionality, it now paints if you have the Painter tab selected. The painter tab shows a different palette dependent on what map view mode you have selected. Elevation palette is saved to user settings.
    - Realised that previous interpretation of pokemon data was wrong, now it's displayed correctly, with each pokemon having more data than just position.
- Move Workspace: Similar to the pokemon and warrior workspaces, moves are displayed in a list where items have a preview of the range of the move, and it's type, power, and name.
- Gimmick Data: Discovered some things such as where the attack power is stored. This is still very much in-progress.

**Fixes**

- Fix issue where mods would be left in a broken state where they crashed whenever opened if pokemon evolutions were modified in 6.0. Those mods will no longer crash, but the evolutions of pokemon will be messed up, you will need to manually go through and fix the evolutions, sorry about this.

## 6.0 <small>- Oct 26, 2024</small> { id="6.0" }

## 5.3 <small>- Dec 11, 2022</small> { id="5.3" }

- Fix crash on scenario warrior page
- Add a different way of specifying exact links, supporting every integer 0-100
- Label "Hit 5 times" move effect correctly

## 5.2 <small>- Nov 17, 2022</small> { id="5.2" }

**Bug Fixes**

- Fix issue with map editor changes being applied to other mods opened due to improper disposal
- Fix crash when attempting to move pokemon/gimmicks outside of map area
- Fix gimmicks not being visually removed from map when deleted
- Fix map selected pokemon position not changing when clicking a new cell

**Features**

- Some useful buttons to set exp to a value that gives an exact link that has been tested to be exact in-game.

## 5.1 <small>- Nov 13, 2022</small> { id="5.1" }

- Compatibility with European rom VPYP. RanseiLink considers this cross-compatible with the North American VPYT, since there is only minor text differences.
- Text filters are now insensitive to accents. e.g. if you search No, it matches N≈ç
- Fixed that the window was cropped a little when full screen
- Basic support to adding and removing messages from the groups that have a message per speaker_id
- Fix map models were able to be patched without having populated graphics defaults, which caused crash
- Changes that are hopefully inconsequential to users: 
  - We have changed IOC to one that is faster, maybe not noticable, but it stacks up as the app grows
  - We are using an MVVM dialog api. This is a step towards complete separation of view and viewmodel, which would make moving to a different (Cross Platform) ui framework much easier.

## 5.0 <small>- Sep 11, 2022</small> { id="5.0" }

**Changes To Installation**

Now there is no longer a need for an installation guide. RanseiLink is published as [self-contained](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/#publish-self-contained). This means the application is a lot bigger, but you no longer need to worry about installing .NET, as the necessary framework is bundled with the app. Just unzip and run.

**What's New**

- Extract battle map 3D models to OBJ, edit them, then re-import into the game. You can create fully custom maps. See the [Map Editing Guide](https://github.com/Deijin27/RanseiLink/wiki/Map-Editing-Guide) to learn more. (Big thanks for [Scurest](https://github.com/scurest), their documentation on NSBMDs helped a lot to getting this working)
- The elevation at which pokemon and gimmick sprites are placed on a map can now be edited to match your custom 3D model
- Disable pokemon and gimmick markers on the PSLM view, making it easier to see when editing elevation
- Pokemon sprite sheets also come with animations. These can now be edited. See the [updated guide](https://github.com/Deijin27/RanseiLink/wiki/Image-Editing-Guide#pokemon-battle-models), and an [tool to help you preview you sprites and animations](https://github.com/Deijin27/pkmdl-previewer). Also be sure to check out [Snap's Guide](https://github.com/Deijin27/RanseiLink/wiki/Pokemon-Battle-Sprite-Creation-Process) for creating pokemon sprites in the conquest style.
- Navigate to messages by warrior by clicking on the link next "Speaker ID" on the base warrior page "tactics tactics tactics"
- Renamed some text parameters in messages to make more sense.
- Omitted constant bits in text parameter values, (where you saw 48, 49, 50, now you will see 0, 1, 2.)
- In text search, include all 3 members of multi-start. messages.

## 4.9 <small>- Jul 26, 2022</small> { id="4.9" }

- Fix bug with image patching
- Fix "append new" not blocked in "Title" where it isn't possible
- Forward and backward navigation for page selection. Only for the which main tab is selected atm.
- List number of overrides on sprite pages
- Overriden sprites have purple number
- View and edit warrior and pokemon sprites on the warrior and pokemon pages

## 4.8 <small>- Jul 23, 2022</small> { id="4.8" }

- Compatibility with japanese rom
- Text and ScenarioWarrior DataGrids now remember scroll position
- Number boxes now allow you to type over selected text

**Important Notes**

VPYT = English rom, VPYJ = Japanese rom. Mods are not cross compatible atm, but you can use the [partial transfer plugin](https://github.com/Deijin27/RanseiLink/wiki/Plugins-by-Deijin#partial-transfer-plugin) to move most data across to a mod of the other game code.

You will need to run "populate graphics defaults" again because they are now stored per-gamecode. This is to allow japanese rom defaults to be accurate.

If you have no intention to use an older version of ranseilink again, you can delete the folder `%localappdata%\RanseiLink\DataProvider`. This is worth doing at some point as it will save you 120MB of storage space.

## 4.7 <small>- Jun 22, 2022</small> { id="4.7" }
